## Bio

---

I am a transportation engineer with expertise in **transportation planning and modeling**, **sustainable and resilient transport systems**, **network analysis and optimization**, **machine learning applications in transport**, and **transport economics and policy**.

I completed my MSc in Transportation Engineering at the **Asian Institute of Technology (AIT)**, where my thesis developed a **Resilience Matrix–Based Bayesian Network** framework to evaluate the resilience of transport systems to flood and climate-related stressors. This work integrated technical, functional, socioeconomic, organizational, and environmental dimensions and focused on practical, data-driven approaches to improve sustainable transport planning in hazard-prone regions.
