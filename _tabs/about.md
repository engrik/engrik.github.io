# 👋 Hi, I’m Imran Khan (Esapzai)

---

I am a transportation engineer with expertise in **network science**, **transportation planning and modeling**, **sustainable and resilient transport**, **machine learning applications**, and **climate adaptation planning**.

I completed my MSc in Transportation Engineering at the **Asian Institute of Technology (AIT)**, where my thesis developed a **Resilience Matrix–Based Bayesian Network** framework to evaluate the resilience of transport systems to flood and climate-related stressors. My work focuses on practical, data-driven approaches to improving transport system resilience in hazard-prone regions.
